    <p>My earliest memory of the internet is using our old 386 and a 14k baud modem to contect to Prodigy to play mad libs. This was a special treat since at that point we were still paying by the minute to be connected to the internet. The internet back then was a totally different animal, we didn't even browse pages back then like we do now. If I recall, Prodgy was more like a collection of news groups and forums than anything else. I could be wrong though, I wasn't really allowed, or capable of browsing by myself, I was maybe 6-7 years old at the most and pretty much had to stick to the games.</p>

    <p>Next came America Online. Good old AOL. At the time it seemed like one of the most amazing things ever. This was the first time I had ever been able to browse the actual internet. The day we upgraded to unlimited service was a landmark day in my life. I read everything on the internet I could get my hands on, its probably part of the reason why I am pretty solid at trivia these days. Who knew that this miraculous service would fail to change with the times and their install cds would eventually be relegated to frisbee status?</p>

    <p>Aside from finally getting a broadband connection, which opened up my eyes to the amazment of playing StarCraft and Unreal Tournament against people all over the world and consumed WAY too many hours of my adolescent life, the next major revelation would be the release of the Google G1. Browsing the internet from a touch screen on my phone was one of the coolest exeriences ever. It literally changed everything, almost any arguement or question could be definitively solved in a matter of seconds (or maybe minutes back then). Driving directions were no longer needed, finding places near by was a piece of cake. Even though the phone is absolutely terrible by todays standards, and even back then it was pretty slow. I am still happy to have been an early adopter, it felt so open source back then, and it blew my and many of my friends minds.</p>

    <p>For me the internet has been a constant source of amazement. It has arguably taught me more than any other single entity and opened more doors for me than anything else. There is hardly an aspect of modern life that hasn't been affected in some way by the internet. It has had educational, political, econimic, and social impacts worldwide. I would definitely consider it the single most important invention I have experienced in my life time and it is probably on par with the invention of movable type for our era.</p>

    <p>In my view the future of the internet seems uncertain. On one hand we have an upcoming generation raised during a time where the internet was essentially ubiquitous. A whole generation of minds ready to use the internet and make it even better than it already is. Economically I feel like the potential gains the world could see from the internet has not even begun to be truely realized. However, behind all this is a power struggle where trade agreements and copyrights and the like, whose aim is consolidate the power over this instrument of information into the hands of just a few powerful governments, people and corporations.</p>

    <p>In time I hope that the needs of the many can out weight the wants of the few. If this becomes a reality then there is no telling how long the internet and the things it gives us continue to blow our minds!</p>
